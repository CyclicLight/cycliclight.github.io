### Polytheism

Though a person may hold a certain deity in higher regard than the rest, many pray to multiple throughout their lives. For example; a grieving son may pray for Moern to protect the spirit of their recently departed mother, a spouse may pray to Tyra to protect their beloved as they cross the sea, whilst an soldier might pray to Caelon for an end to the war.
