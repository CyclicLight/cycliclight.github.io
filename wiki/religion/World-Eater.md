**The World-Eater** (also called **The Mad Divine**) is draconic deity imprisoned by [the Shards](Pantheon) within a pocket realm. It's release is usually accompanied by the end of a cycle and thus the remaking of the world, only once has this been in part avoided (see [The Reshaping](/wiki/events/The-Reshaping)).

The World-Eater is known to whisper to inhabitants of the material plane usually speaking of bringing order.
