## Biology
Birdfolk are humanoid birds. They're covered in feathers and their arms and legs end with clawed three pointed extremities.

Birdfolk are split into two major subspecies: Flying & Flightless. The major differentiating factor is the connection between their arms and wings. For flying birdfolk these are separate limbs that can move independently whilst for the flightless their wings and arms are one.

Though they are called flightless, birdfolk of this subspecies can still use their wings to glide but not propel themselves upward.

## Mythology

Birdfolk are believed to have been created by [Caelon](/wiki/religion/Caelon.html) & [Lokin](/wiki/religion/Lokin.html) as humanoid flying doves & flightless ravens before mutating to a wide range of complexions and featheredge.

## Homelands

Flightless birdfolk are found in larger groups in the Vash forest. Settling in peaceful & druidic tribes.

Flying birdfolk are more commonly found in the mountains to the north of Khartor & the Vashlands.
