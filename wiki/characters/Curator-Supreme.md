The **Curator Supreme** (also known as **The Intern**) is a Human Rune-Sorcerer currently acting as the Curator of the Museum of Ancient Artifacts. 

## History

### Search for the Ancient Artifacts

The Intern as he was known then, served as an intern for [The Curator](The-Curator) during the search for the Ancient Artifacts. He was fired before the discovery of the second one, following which he took an internship at the Red Oasis arena. When the arena's master was murdered by [The Rider](The-Rider) he returned to the Museum of Ancient Artifacts to once again serve as an intern.

Whilst the adventurers were looking for the final artifact (The Frostwalkers), the Intern was thrown into a hidden jail cell by the Curator. He was released shortly after by the returning adventurers. With the fall of the previous Curator, he took up the rank instead.

Following his ascension, to the rank of Curator, the Intern took on the name *Curator Supreme* and began researching rune magic. Before the Reshaping took effect, he fortified the runes around the Museum and called for the adventurers to join him in the (hopefully) safety of the Museum.

### The Reshaping

The Curator Supreme was not present at the Museum when the adventurers awoke following the Reshaping. His whereabouts are currently unknown.
