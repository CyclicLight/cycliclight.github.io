**The Curator** was a Minotaur-Myconid Cleric who served as the curator of the Museum of Ancient Artifacts and wielded the staff of the Last Knight. They were executed by the [Artifact Adventurers](/wiki/organisations/Artifact-Adventurers) after they opened the Veil Gate within [The Knighthold](/wiki/places/The-Knighthold).

## History

### Third Cycle

At some point, the person who'd eventually become the Curator joined up with a group of other adventurers and went on adventurers that eventually culminated in the discovery of the Knighthold. Within the Knighthold the party found a set of (unbeknownst to them) cursed artifacts belonging to [The Last Knight](Last-Knight). The Curator was given the staff of this set which became known as "The Curator's Staff". After this adventure the party split.

Sometime following this the Curator established what would become the Museum of Ancient Artifacts with support from their former adventuring partner, [Lord Minder](Lord-Minder)

Nearing the end of the Third Cycle, all other adventurers in the party had fallen to the corruptive whispers of the artifacts they carried. The Curator remaining the only one unaffected.

### Fourth Cycle

Shielded by the power infused into the Curator's Staff the Museum survived the end of the Third Cycle near undisturbed and for a time following the Curator lived in quiet solitude, until a new community began to take form near the Museum. From this community they recruited [The Intern](Curator-Supreme).

### Hunt for the Ancient Artifacts

With a new community of capable adventurers growing nearby The Curator began to search for what remained of their lost comrades and the artifacts they held. Finding [Dugh Molir](/wiki/places/Dugh-Molir) nearby.
