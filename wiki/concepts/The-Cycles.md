For an unbeknownst amount of time the world has gone through a cycle of being consumed and reborn at the breath of the World-Eater. This fact is unknown to most living within the realms.

Though a majority of the previous cycle is lost some ruins linger beneath the surface of the world and some knowledge leaks through to the next. Examples of this include [The Knighthold](/wiki/places/The-Knighthold) and the great stretches of tunnels reaching across Tav'esh from the Undercity of the Second Cycle.

The current cycle is commonly referred to as the **Fourth Cycle**.
