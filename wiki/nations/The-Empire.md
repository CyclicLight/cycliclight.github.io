**The Empire** was a collection of territories in central [Tav'esh](/wiki/continents/Tav'esh) that formed the Imperial Expanse. It fell a decade prior to the Reshaping when the reigning emperor was murdered on his birthday.

## History

### Rise

The Empire was initially formed around 3 centuries before the Reshaping pulling together several territories under one rule.

### Corruption

Over the centuries the Empire was beset by corruption at all levels of government. The political games played by rivalling nobles spilled over into the capital and eventually became a deep rooted part of Imperial high-society.

### Fall

On the 49th birthday of the last emperor the Pirate Monarch of [Mycelia](/wiki/nations/Mycelia) fired the bullet that ended the Empire. It is believed that they pulled the strings of the corrupt nobility to let them enter the capital and murder the emperor. The Lords had then each believed they'd take the throne leading to the following civil war and quick end to the Empire. It is believed this end was the Pirate's intention all along.
