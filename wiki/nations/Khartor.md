**Khartor** is an originally dwarven nation in the north of the Highheats of [Tav'esh](/wiki/continents/Tav'esh). It's capital of the same name is lodged into the northern mountain range and is the oldest still occupied stronghold of dwarven history.

It primarily trades in ore & crafts. All members of Khartor society are encouraged from an early age to take up a craft and perfect it.

## Governance
Khartor's society put a great value on craftsmanship and it's rulers are included in that. The position of monarch is not based solely on lineage, possible heirs are when the preceeding ruler ceased their reign judged by their creations. To ascend to the throne one must craft an addition to the Royal set, this craft must be of unparalleled quality. This set already contains a number of items and as such the challenge rises with every reign.

It is currently ruled by **Queen Tymera Kinshield**.

## History

### Wildsbrook War

The Wildsbrook War was a conflict between Khartor & [Aeros](Aeros) that broke out after the shared settlement Wildsbrook was burnt to the ground for unknown reasons with both nations blaming the other. The conflict lasted to varying degrees from 36 years before the Reshaping to 19 when the current Queen rose to the throne in Aeros.

During this conflict the previous King fell in battle and the throne was set to be given to one of his children, Tydor- and Tymera Kinshield. Whilst Tydor was expected to take the throne but disappeared during a journey into the depths of the mountain in search for the strongest metal in the ground to forge a weapon that would win the war. Instead Tymera arose and saw Khartor through the end of the war.
