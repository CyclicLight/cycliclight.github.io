Though originally part of the [Vallendrian Empire](Vallendrian-Empire), Lyascen has always held a greater degree of independence due to it's religious importance. It is believed that the peaks of it's mountain heights is where [the Shards](/wiki/religion/Pantheon.md) convened in the early ages of history.

Among other minor temples the nation also holds the primary hold of the Morugarde.
