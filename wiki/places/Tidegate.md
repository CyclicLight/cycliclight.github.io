A free port in the former [Vallendria](/wiki/nations/Vallendrian-Empire). Named after the now broken tide gate toward the ocean.

It is located directly south (and down river) from the Vallendrian capital as well as east of the Highheaths cliffs of [Aeros](/wiki/nations/Aeros).

Tidegate is home to an assortment of sailors, magic users, and peddlers of goods. If you want to travel without papers or inspection this is where you go. So long as you don't make a mess in town.

## History

Originally established to guard the river way to the capital. After the nation's fall it was quickly abandoned by the guards assigned to it. 

Around 7 [BD](/wiki/event/The-Divine-Storm), it was settled again by opportunists.

## Governance

Led by a pair of nobles who watch the town from a manor.

## Appearance

A mish-mash of old refurnished buildings & driftwood houses. The town is split from the Harbour in the South-West to the North-Eastern gate by a wide trade street.
