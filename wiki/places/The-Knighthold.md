**The Knighthold** is an underground stronghold containing a [Veil Gate](/wiki/concepts/Veil-Gates.md).

## History

### Before Third Cycle
Sometime before the Third Cycle it housed an organisation of knights. The inhabitants were turned to stone statues when the World-Eater broke free and ended the cycle.

The armor worn by the last remaining knight was eventually corrupted by the World-Eater.

Due to shifting during cycles, the position of the Knighthold has changed several times.

### Third Cycle

Sometime during the Third Cycle the Knighthold was discovered by a group of adventurers containing [The Curator](/wiki/characters/The-Curator.md) who recovered the Last Knight's armor.

### Fourth Cycle

In the Fourth Cycle, the Knighthold was found again by The Curator and then visited by the [Artifact Adventurers](/wiki/organisations/Artifact-Adventurers) following the recovery of the Last Knight's Set (now known as "The Ancient Artifacts"). At this time the Veil Gate was opened causing [The Reshaping](/wiki/event/The-Reshaping).

### After the Reshaping

The location of the Knighthold shifted yet again with the Reshaping and has yet to be rediscovered.
