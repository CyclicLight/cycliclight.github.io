The Museum of Ancient Artifacts is a museum founded in the Third Cycle by [The Curator](/wiki/characters/The-Curator.md) with resources provided by [Lord Minder](/wiki/characters/Lord-Minder).

## History

### Third Cycle

The museum was established by The Curator following the dissolution of their adventuring party with resources donated by Lord Minder.

At the end of the Third Cycle, the structure was protected by a power beyond.

### Fourth Cycle

During the Fourth Cycle, The Curator assembled the [Artifact Adventurers](/wiki/organisations/Artifact-Adventurers) to gather the remaining Ancient Artifacts for display in the museum. At some point during this campaign, they were corrupted by the whispers emanating from the Ancient Artifacts and established a jail cell underneath the ground floor.

After the fall of the Curator, control of the museum was given to the former intern, now [Curator Supreme](/wiki/characters/Curator-Supreme.md).

### The Reshaping

At the brink of the Reshaping, Curator Supreme gathered all those he could find within the Museum and erected a barrier of runes around its grounds to protect it. Without an amplifying power such as the Curator's Staff, this endeavor was only partially successful and the Museum was left in a degraded state.
