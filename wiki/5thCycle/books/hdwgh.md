## Chapter 1: The Storm

On the *26th of February*, at the tail of the year before the end (-1 BD), a storm of pure divine energy emerged around [Tev'esh](/wiki/continents/Tev'esh), a minor continent along the equator.

It seems that is where this all began.

The morning of the 27th was a rainy one, a blessing perhaps from the [*Lady of Storms*](/wiki/religion/Pantheon). From the dark, the [*Veilwalkers*](/wiki/creatures/Veilwalker) emerged, weakened by the waters but still stronger than most. Their onslaught was constant, *is constant*.

In the following months, the *Divine Storm* grew increasingly unstable expelling great volumes of energy. These sub-storms cut through the land like blades in the dark, tearing it apart, changing it, remaking it. Perhaps this is the force of creation?

## Chapter 2: The Fallen Harmony

Putting an exact date on this event is difficult if not impossible. It would require an understanding of [*the Shards*](/wiki/religion/Pantheon) beyond what we could dream of.

In the aftermath of a a stormwrought night, a font of pure divine energy was discovered. It glowed a pleasant gold & filled watchers with warmth. Over years as more were discovered, clerics of [*Caelon*](/wiki/religion/Caelon) reported a worrying absence within them. His gifts fading.

The conclusion was a terrifying one, *Caelon* was dying or perhaps already dead. This leaves a question with follow ups that lead many to hesitate; What can kill a god? [*The World-Eater*](/wiki/religion/World-Eater)? Another one of *the Shards*? Something else?
