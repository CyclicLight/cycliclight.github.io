## Chapter 1: The Storm

On the *26th of February*, at the tail of the year before the end (-1 BD), a storm of pure divine energy emerged around [Tev'esh](/wiki/continents/Tev'esh), a minor continent along the equator.

It seems that is where this all began.

___

The morning of the 27th was a rainy one, a blessing perhaps from the [*Lady of Storms*](/wiki/religion/Pantheon). From the dark, the [*Veilwalkers*](/wiki/creatures/Veilwalker) emerged, weakened by the waters but still stronger than most. Their onslaught was constant, *is constant*.

In the following months, the *Divine Storm* grew increasingly unstable expelling great volumes of energy. These sub-storms cut through the land like blades in the dark, tearing it apart, changing it, remaking it. Perhaps this is the force of creation?

## Chapter 2: The Fallen Harmony

Putting an exact date on this event is difficult if not impossible. It would require an understanding of [*the Shards*](/wiki/religion/Pantheon) beyond what we could dream of.

In the aftermath of a a stormwrought night, a font of pure divine energy was discovered. It glowed a pleasant gold & filled watchers with warmth. Over years as more were discovered, clerics of [*Caelon*](/wiki/religion/Caelon) reported a worrying absence within them. His gifts fading. 

___

The conclusion was a terrifying one, *Caelon* was dying or perhaps already dead. This leaves a question with follow ups that lead many to hesitate; What can kill a god? [*The World-Eater*](/wiki/religion/World-Eater)? Another one of *the Shards*? Something else?

What happens to war when there's no peace?

## Chapter 3: The Automata

In the years preceding the *Divine Storm*, the magnates & plutocrats of *Embith's Flame* on [*Scorge*](/wiki/continents/Scorge) (a sweltering continent south of *the Central Sea*) had thrown their weight behind the eponymous Embith.

The dragonborn had made great strides in technology during the years since her appearance. All of which paid off when the *Automata* project was 'completed'. Self-replicating, self-managing, *Warforged*.

Which war? The investors'? Doubtful. Shortly following the completion, *Embith* was taken by *Moern*. The Automata then took on a task not specified by *the great investors*: finding their maker, by any means.

## Chapter 4: The Undead

Before their battle in the [*Vallendrian Capital*](/wiki/nations/Vallendrian-Empire), the prime objective of the Morugarde was the erradication of the Undead. It is no well-kept secret that their ability to achieve this mission has been compromised since.

One needn't look further than the night to observe the consequences, the dead stalk these lands. Another foe to send shivers down the masses' spines. Whichever masses remain that is.

## Chapter 5: The Gilded

When Vallendria fell to *Monarch*'s *Scorgian arm*, it was not the noblity who fell but the common folk, the powerful remained powerful. When the *Crystal Fields* erupted, the *High Seats* did not budge. 
The *Gilded*, they live on. Power 

The *Gilded* act for themselves, damned be the world.

## Chapter X: Crossfire

Alliances are an exception to the world state. The *Automata* are strict in their search but greatly oppose the *Veilwalkers*. 

The *Undead* are less clear, too many necromancers and [*vampires*](/wiki/creatures/Vampires), some join forces with the *Veilwalkers*, others with the *Gilded*, rarely with the *Automata*.
