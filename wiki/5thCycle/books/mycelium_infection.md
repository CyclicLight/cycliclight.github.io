# Research Notes

Topic: *Mycelium Infection*

Subject: *Vanan*

Researcher: *Vanan*

### Background

We originally encountered the Mycelium in the cellar of a tavern ruin.

Most samples were confined to glass vials in an elaborate lockbox. The ones that were not had spread through the room.

We walked through it.

### Observations 1:

The infection was not obvious at first, it was not until I next took a hit in combat. The Mycelium made itself known, filling my wounds with itself.

Overtime, my own flesh replaced it again, at least visually. I have refrained from digging beneath it for now.

### Observations 2:

It speaks, I can't quite understand it but I can feel it. It has a desire.

Our Camp is fraught with dangers. Kobolds have tried to run us over. I've taken deeper wounds in the past days. The Mycelium has spread.

I have picked up the healing arts once more to attempt to heal myself without out.

I question what it'd do if I lost a finger or the like.
