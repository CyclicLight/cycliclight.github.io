## Necessary Tools

*If you do not have any of these tools, they will be supplied through the adoption process.*

### Dragon Command Staff:

This staff allows you to train your Dragon to Stay, Follow, and Wander.

### Dragon Horn:

This horn allows you to conveniently Transport your Dragon.

### Dragon Bone Flute:

This flute allows you to call your Dragon down from Flight.

## Environment / Nest

*Dragons require the following things to have a comfortable home.*

- A Large Space
- Indoor and Outdoor Access
- A Horde of Treasure

Dragons need a large space to roam around in. This includes Indoor and Outdoor Access. Usually a cave to sleepin and access to the sky for healthy flight.

Dragons also like to collect treasure, so their nest should contain many treasures, from shiny jewels and metals, to interesting trinkets and battle spoils.

## Growing Up

Dragons grow in size every day, this can be accelerate by feeding them *Dragon Meal*.

There are 5 stages of development, detailed here:

| **Stage** | **Days** |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1 | 0-24 |
| 2 | 25-49 |
| 3 | 50 - 74 |
| 4 | 75-99 |
| 5 | 100 - 124 |
| Fully Grown | 125+ |

### WARNING!

It is not advised to allow your dragon to exceed **Stage 4** as they become too big to live comfortably.

You can feed a Dragon a *Sticky Dragon Meal* to halt their growth.
