## Rituals & Traditions

**The Great Leap of Faith**

Every devout follower must prove their faith by jumping off a high place into a body of water while shouting "Ribbitus guide me!"

**The Nightly Croak**

At sunset, all followers must crouch and spam the jump button whle making frog noises in unison. This pleases the Frogfather.

**The Feast of the Frogspawn**

Once a season, followers must gather and throw slimeballs at each other in a joyous celebration of froggy prosperity.

## Prophecies & Divine Rewards

It is said that the most devout of Froglings will, upon death, ascend to the Grand Swamp in the Sky, where the lily pads are endless, the water is always warm, and the insects are forever plentiful.

Those who betray the Frogfather will be sent to The Nether Bog, a fiery swamp where Magma Cubes hop eternally, and the frogs never croak in joy.

**Final Prayer**

May your jumps be high, your tongue be quick, and your heart be forever froggy. Ribbit be with you.
