Tav'esh is the largest continent on the world's surface. 

## Highheaths
The Highheaths is the western region of the continent, located upon a heath, therefore the name. Beneath the land runs a nexus of leylines, causing the emergence of grand arcane crystals across the surface.

## Sevract
Though known prior as "The Imperial Expanse", the central region of the continent was unoffially called "The Severed Tract" after [the Empire](/wiki/nations/The-Empire)'s fall a decade prior to the Reshaping. This was shortened to Sevract over the years.

Following the fall of the Empire the region fell into war, an uneasy peace was established between the rivalling lords after several years of bloodshed. Many of the towns previously protected by the Empire were left without support after the fall with many falling into ruin or being forced to create new local militias.

## Vash'lands
The Vash'lands is the eastern region of the continent, named after the great forest Vash'el.
