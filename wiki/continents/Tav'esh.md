Tav'esh is the largest continent on the world's surface. 

## Highheaths
The Highheaths is the western region of the continent, located upon a heath, therefore the name. Beneath the land runs a nexus of leylines, causing the emergence of grand arcane crystals across the surface.

## Vallendria
Named after [the Empire of Vallendria](/wiki/nations/Vallendrian-Empire.md), the central region of Tav'esh was united for about a century before the Empire's fall a decade prior to the Reshaping.

Following the fall of the Empire the region was thrown into war, an uneasy peace was established between the rivalling lords after several years of bloodshed. Many of the towns previously protected by the Empire were left without support after the fall with many falling into ruin or being forced to create new local militias.
