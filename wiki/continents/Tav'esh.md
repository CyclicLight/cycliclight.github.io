Tav'esh is the largest continent on the world's surface. 

## Highheaths
The Highheaths is the western region of the continent, located upon a heath, therefore the name. Beneath the land runs a nexus of leylines, causing the emergence of grand arcane crystals across the surface.

## Vallendria
Named after [the Empire of Vallendria](/wiki/nations/Vallendrian-Empire), the central region of Tav'esh was united for about a century before the Empire's fall around 10 BD.

Following the fall of the Empire the region was left without support as former members states of the Empire retracted their guards to defend their core lands.

Many towns previously protected by the Empire were left without support with many falling into ruin or being forced to create local militias. Even with this, much of the region is substantially more dangerous than before.
