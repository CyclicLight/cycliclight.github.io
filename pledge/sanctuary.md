        <h3> What is Sanctuary? </h3>
        <p>
            Sanctuary is an island nation in the Central Sea. Ruled by a council representing different schools of research and one Arch Scholar, selected by means unknown.

            No subject of research is discouraged within the grounds. Knowledge others may consider dangerous is a natural by-product of pushing the limits. It's not to be feared.
